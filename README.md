## Flexible Sheet in Vacuo

This is a project based on [LilyPad](https://github.com/weymouth/lily-pad) to test the structure solver of flexible sheets 
without the presence of fluids. 

The final version of this code will be integrated in the forked version of [LilyPad](https://github.com/aristotelis86/lily-pad) for further testing in actual fluid-(flexible) structure interaction cases.

Videos from some test case are uploaded on [Youtube]().
